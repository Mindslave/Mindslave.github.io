# Marius Kimmina
Hey There! I'm an IT-Security Student and work as a Developer for QGoup GmbH in Germany.  
I'm interested in Hacking Challenges, Go programming, DevOps and Bug Hunting.  
Those are also the most prominent topics on this Blog, sometimes I wander off into other areas tho,  
such as Malware analysis.
